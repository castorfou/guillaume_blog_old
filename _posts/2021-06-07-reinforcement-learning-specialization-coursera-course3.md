my notes on [course 1 - Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning](/guillaume_blog/blog/reinforcement-learning-specialization-coursera.html), [course 2 - Sample-based Learning Methods](/guillaume_blog/blog/reinforcement-learning-specialization-coursera-course2.html)

**specialization roadmap** - course 3 - **Prediction and Control with Function Approximation**

**course 3** - In Course 3, we leave the relative comfort of small finite MDPs and investigate RL with **function approximation**. Here we will see that the main concepts from Courses 1 and 2 transferred to problems with larger **infinite state spaces**. We will cover **feature construction**, **neural network learning**, **policy gradient methods**, and other particularities of the function approximation setting.



Week 1 - On-policy Prediction with Approximation

Week 2 - Constructing Features for Prediction

Week 3 - Control with Approximation

Week 4 - Policy Gradient
