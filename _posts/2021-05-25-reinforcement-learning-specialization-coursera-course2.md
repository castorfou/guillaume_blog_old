**specialization roadmap** - course 2 - **Sample-based Learning Methods**

**course 2** - In Course 2, we built on these ideas and design algorithms for learning **without a model** of the world. We study three classes of methods designed for learning from trial and error interaction. We start with **Monte Carlo** methods and then move on to **temporal difference** learning, including Q learning. We conclude Course 2 with an investigation of methods for **planning** with learned models. 



Week 1 - Monte-Carlo Methods for Prediction & Control

Week 2 - Temporal Difference Learning Methods for Prediction

Week 3 - Temporal Difference Learning Methods for Control

Week 4 - Planning, Learning & Acting



## 5/25/21 - Course 2 - Week 1 - Monte-Carlo Methods for Prediction & Control
