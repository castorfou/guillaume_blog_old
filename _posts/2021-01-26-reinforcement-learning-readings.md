## 1/26/21 - Reinforcement learning for real-world robotics

from [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Obek04C8L5E&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Obek04C8L5E&feature=youtu.be)

at 26' idea that you can tackle over-optimism models by using ensemble models.
See paper at [2018 Model-Ensemble Trust-Region Policy Optimization](https://github.com/castorfou/datascience-papers/blob/main/RL/2018%20Model-Ensemble%20Trust-Region%20Policy%20Optimization/model_ensemble_trust_region_policy_optimization.pdf)



## 1/26/21 - Reinforcement Learning algorithms — an intuitive overview

from [https://medium.com/@SmartLabAI/reinforcement-learning-algorithms-an-intuitive-overview-904e2dff5bbc](https://medium.com/@SmartLabAI/reinforcement-learning-algorithms-an-intuitive-overview-904e2dff5bbc)

give an overview of various RL models. Model-based vs model-free.

And papers and codes.

## 1/26/21 - Reinforcement learning, partie 1 : introduction (in French)

There is a reference to an introduction paper:
Inspiré de : Sutton, Richard S., and Andrew G. Barto.
[« Reinforcement learning : an introduction. » (2011)](https://github.com/castorfou/datascience-papers/blob/main/RL/2015%20Reinforcement%20Learning%20an%20introduction%20-%20Sutton%2C%20Richard%20S.%2C%20and%20Andrew%20G.%20Barto/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf). (I have an updated version from 2015)
