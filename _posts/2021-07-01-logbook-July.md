## Week 26 - July 21

**Thursday 7/1**

Paper reviewed on *arxiv* about **revisiting Deep Learning Models for Tabular Data**. [arXiv:2106.11959v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11959v1) (FT-Transformer, ResNet, MLP) architectures can compete with GBDT models. Examples are not detailed in paper but code seems available  at https://github.com/yandex-research/rtdl (rtdl (**R**evisiting **T**abular **D**eep **L**earning) based on PyTorch)
