A course by [Thomas Simonini](https://www.simoninithomas.com/)

[Syllabus (from 2018)](https://simoninithomas.github.io/Deep_reinforcement_learning_Course/) 

[kind of syllabus (from 2020)](https://medium.com/deep-reinforcement-learning-course/launching-deep-reinforcement-learning-course-v2-0-38fa3c24bcbc)

Everything available in [github](https://github.com/simoninithomas/Deep_reinforcement_learning_Course)

I appreciate the effort to update examples, and some 2018 implementations became obsolete. Historical Atari VC2600 games are now Starcraft 2 or minecraft, and news series on building AI for video games in Unity and Unreal Engine..



## (2/19/21) - Step 1 - An Introduction to Deep Reinforcement Learning?

Previous version from [2018: What is Deep Reinforcement Learning?](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/an-introduction-to-reinforcement-learning-4339519de419) is quite interesting. 

[Updated version](https://thomassimonini.medium.com/an-introduction-to-deep-reinforcement-learning-17a565999c0c) from 2020

This is a good starting point, well explained.
