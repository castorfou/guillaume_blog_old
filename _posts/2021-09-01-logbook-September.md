## Week 35 - September 21

**Thursday 9/2**

Paper reviewed on *arxiv* about **Continuous Control With Deep Reinforcement Learning**. (Lillicrap et. al - 2015) [arXiv:1509.02971](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971). This is about DDPG. Initial [paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/silver14.html) comes from David Silver: *Deterministic policy gradient algorithms* in ICML 2014, but is not easy to read. Here is a [review from towardsdatascience](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-deterministic-policy-gradients-explained-2d94655a9b7b), in which the Deep Deterministic Policy  Gradients (DDPG) is presented, and is written for people who wish to  understand the DDPG algorithm.
