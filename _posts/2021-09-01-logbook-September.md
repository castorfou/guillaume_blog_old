## Week 35 - September 21

**Thursday 9/2**

Paper reviewed on *arxiv* about **Continuous Control With Deep Reinforcement Learning**. (Lillicrap et. al - 2015) [arXiv:1509.02971](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971). This is about DDPG. Initial [paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/silver14.html) comes from David Silver: *Deterministic policy gradient algorithms* in ICML 2014, but is not easy to read. Here is a [review from towardsdatascience](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-deterministic-policy-gradients-explained-2d94655a9b7b), in which the Deep Deterministic Policy  Gradients (DDPG) is presented, and is written for people who wish to  understand the DDPG algorithm.

## Week 36 - September 21

**Monday 9/6**

Install of [barrier](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier/releases) to share keyboard/mouse between linux and windows

Move wsl to another drive with [move-wsl](https://github.com/pxlrbt/move-wsl)

**Wednesday 9/9**

Creation of [custom gym environment](https://github.com/castorfou/handson_stablebaselines3/blob/main/gym_handson/01%20-%20Create%20custom%20gym%20environments%20from%20scratch%20.ipynb) and optimization using DQN, then DDPG with [stable baselines 3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3). Takes around 50,000 steps to optimize a ultra simple grid problem... No success with DDPG, something missing?
