**Video Andy Barto on What are Eligibility Traces and Why are they so named?**

By the end of this video, you'll *understand* the **origin** of the idea of **eligibility traces** and you'll actually *see* that you've been **using a variant of eligibility traces** all along.

###### Project Resources

**Video Let's Review: Markov Decision Processes**

By the end of this video, you'll be able to *understand* **Markov decision processes or MDPs** and *describe* how the **dynamics of MDP** are defined. 

**Video Let's Review: Examples of Episodic and Continuing Tasks**

By the end of this video, you will be able to *understand* when to formalize a task as **episodic or continuing**.
