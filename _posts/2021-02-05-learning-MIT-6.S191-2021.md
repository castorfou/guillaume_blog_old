From [http://introtodeeplearning.com/](http://introtodeeplearning.com/)

I keep all content (lectures, notebooks) in [github](https://github.com/castorfou/mit_6s191)

This is done with google contribution, and therefore all examples are in tensorflow. I will try to adapt notebooks in PyTorch.



## 2/5/21 - Intro to Deep Learning - lecture 1

Intro is just jaw-dropping!

[2020 intro](https://youtu.be/5tvmMX8r_OM?list=PLtBw6njQRU-rwp5__7C0oIVt26ZgjG9NI&t=40) was top. 

[2021 intro](https://youtu.be/5tvmMX8r_OM?list=PLtBw6njQRU-rwp5__7C0oIVt26ZgjG9NI&t=149) is just awesome. 

It is a standard overview of simple deep learning concepts: Perceptron, multi-perceptron, dense layers, loss, gradient-descent, backprop, SGD, regularization, dropout, early stoppping

(to continue to adapt labs (notebooks) to Pytorch)



## 2/15/21 - Deep Sequence Modeling - lecture 2

New lecturer: Ava Soleimany

Nice introduction to sequence modeling with Many-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many.
