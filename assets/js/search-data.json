            "content": "Blogging from github . fastai and fastpages . I am a big fan of fastai’s spirit and even more of their leaders: . Jeremy Howards | Rachel Thomas | Sylvain Gugger who is know at huggingface. | . They are commited to beautiful ideas, and are inspiring people. I like their courses. I like their softwares. For sure I will discuss about fastai. They have created fastpages. It turns github into a blogging platform. I don’t have the full detail but it is explained in fastpages github repo It is based on github actions, and by just creating a repo from a fastpages template https://github.com/fastai/fast_template/generate and giving a couple of settings, you are ready to go. . And here I have to thank Hamel Husain. He is from github company and I think he is behing github actions and helped fastai to release fastpages. I don’t know Hamel but he looks like a humble, terribly skilled guy, with tons of energy. Thanks Hamel. . my blog . My main audience is the future me. (maybe not entirely true otherwise I would have written in French) In 1 year, I want to turn back to this blog and I would like to see all the learning peaces I went through. I want this platform to be as easy as possible. . fastpages . For the moment it cannot be easier. I have setup the about page. And each blog entry is just a new markdown page into _posts. github _posts: . . By commiting this page, there are internal actions being run automatically (through github actions magic) and after a couple of minutes the new blog pages are generated (using Jekyl and ruby if I am not wrong). For the moment I use github web interface. But I guess it is easier to have a local repo of my blog, create new entries and when satisfied git push to github. (to be tested later) . github accounts . For a reason I used my personal github account (guillaume.ramelet@gmail.com) and not my professional one (guillaume.ramelet@michelin.com). I will see later if I have to move to another account. I had some troubles to setup actions into github. For a reason I thought it was available only for organization account. So I have turned my michelin github account to an organization, and I cannot login anymore. To be fixed later. . markdown . Ok I am not a huge fan of markdown. I use it as a basic text system specially within notebooks. But it is not as easy to insert images. Currently I screenshot what I want to share, insert into images folder of my repo and reference this image from my blog post using markdown language. I definitely have to improve my practice of markdown, and there are multiple cheatsheets to be used. . jupyter . There are options within fastpages to blog from jupyter notebooks. I have to do it. My intent will be to use this place to share my knowledge. Today most of my knowledge comes from experiences I make within jupyter. If I could directly blog from that it will be great. . comments . OK as the sole reader this is maybe a minor concern but there is no commenting system associated with fastpages. I cannot get any feedback from these entries. Would love to get advices, create discussions within that blog. Not for today. .",

            "title": "Becoming Datascientist",
            "content": "Why becoming a datascientist . March 2019 . This journey has started about 1 year ago. . No wait, that was dormant for a long time before that. I guess I have to go back to my studying time: at that time my days were full of maths and computers. And my days were flying as crazy. It happens to me (to you?) when you’re just in a middle of something you like very much. 10 hours looks like 1. And the opposite is true as well. . 2000 - 2004: software development . Most of my days and weekends at that time were dedicated to code in Java and bash. Java mainly for server-side developpement in J2EE at Unilog Management. Bash from time to time to automate some tasks on my personal PC. At that time it was mainly about learning what is an operating system. I had started with LFS (Linux From Scratch). And in 2002 with Gentoo which was a much more powerful way to mimic LFS. . 2004 - 2009: project management . Strange period. I don’t remember exactly why but I had a shift in my professional orientation. I moved away from software development and turned into a project manager. In 2005 I entered into Michelin company. And sofwtare technical matters at that time were considered as unimportant (and embarrassing subjects) Fortunately in 2009 I have been started my agile journey. A lot to learn, and it was less about software than human relations and empathy. It was like a start from scratch. . 2009 - 2015: agile journey . Quite a new world for me. I had some basic knowledge by following Jono Bacon. At that time he was a community manager|release leader at Ubuntu. And was reporting progress using burndown charts. In 2009 I launched a project to create an employee portal (closed to what netvibes and igoogle were at that time). Using standard java portal technologies and more importantly using agile approach. A lot to learn about Agile, Scrum, and endless discussions about how to introduce Agile into a non-Agile organization. In 2010 I started another more ambitious project, with many colleagues (~30 persons) and a vague vision. It was about to create a product lifecycle management solution for semi-finished products. . 2015 - 2017: lean journey . In 2015, I met lean approaches for office. I was immediately convinced there was powerful and deep roots within lean. And it could bring a lot to people and organizations. I turned into a lean coach, to work with teams identifying what they could improve, how they could work better, with more pleasure. . 2017 - 2019: Welcome to USA! . Nice opportunity at that time to move from Clermont-Ferrand (France) to Greenville, South Carolina (USA). I have loved every part of it. Except maybe that 2 years were too short to make a full tour of this amazing country. It is crazy to think how different we are when we look like the same. . 2019 - : back to France and turning as a datascientist . Sept 2019 - back to France and for 4 months to prepare for a complete new position: datascientist for Manufacturing within Michelin. I spent many days to learn from various sources specially datacamp and Andrew Ng. That was just the beginning. My intent was to move away from project management, team leadership and focus about what I can do by myself. I wanted to return to math domains without giving up an IT landscape. My colleague Francois Deheeger told me about data science and Artificial Intelligence. That looked as interesting as terrifying. I was in. I was not afraid to learn a new language, and to restart my career from scratch. .",
